My Name is Caleb Jacobsen and my email address is freshfoam44@gmail.com
The GitHub account that I created uses my personal email address and it very new because I made it for this assignment.
The repository I created is called Calebsrty.Github.io and currently only contains the readme.
To clone my repository I just opened the GitHub desktop app and there it immediately showed me my repository and gave me the option to clone it underneath.
